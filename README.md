# Edutech-and-Alumini-networks
Central System for Alumni-Student Connection


Problem Statement :

India’s higher education ecosystem produces millions of graduates each year, yet many
students struggle to access networks for jobs, mentorship, and career guidance while alumni
miss out on opportunities to give back meaningfully.
Fragmented communication, informal referral channels, and legacy portals limit impact.
Develop a technology-driven platform—using AI, secure digital identity, social graphs, or new
engagement protocols—that fosters dynamic, transparent, and mutually beneficial connections
between alumni and students.
The solution should enhance job placements, real-time guidance, skill-building, and community
engagement, supporting trusted referrals and scalable career support in rapidly evolving
academic landscapes.


Challenge Statement :

Propose and build a digital solution that strengthens alumni-student engagement, delivers
real-time mentorship, and enables trusted career referrals. Your innovation should:
● Use advanced network protocols, secure identity, or intelligent matching to improve
connectivity.
● Facilitate scalable job and internship placement, mentorship, and community
participation.
● Demonstrate impact through job offers, engagement metrics, or mentoring outcomes in
pilot deployments.
